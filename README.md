- `levels.py`: Contains the logic for each game level (Easy, Medium, and Hard).
- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions such as generating random numbers and validating user input.
- `constants.py`: Stores constants and messages used throughout the game.

## Features

- **Easy Level**: Guess a number between 1 and 10.

- **Hard Level**: Set your own range, guess the number, but with a limited number of attempts based on the range size.
